    <h1>Inspiration for this game</h1>
    <p>
      I grew up playing Oregon trail in elementary school as it was reward in one of my classes. However, at the time it was a
      source of both joy and frustration. I was always baffled by the river crossing and failing at it numerous times. This is my
      tribute to it and attempt to recreate some of the fun.
