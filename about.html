    <h1>Inspiration for this game</h1>
    <p>

      Embark on a nostalgic journey reminiscent of my elementary school days, where Oregon Trail served as a cherished
      reward in one of my classes. This game holds a special place in my heart, evoking a mix of joy and frustration
      during those unforgettable moments. The seemingly insurmountable challenge of river crossings left me baffled,
      failing time and again.

      Now, this game stands as my tribute to those childhood memories and a sincere attempt to recreate the exhilarating
      fun of the Oregon Trail. Join me in reliving the adventure, navigating challenges, and rediscovering the magic
      that made it a timeless classic. Welcome to a digital homage that captures the essence of the original, offering
      both a nod to the past and a chance to forge new memories.
